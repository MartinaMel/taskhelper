Taskhelper
==========

Taskhelper is a dynamic Android application that allows for "wizard" style applications to be defined using JSON and synced with the device in the form of a ToDo list. There is also a server side component that handles the synchronisation and data storage.

Building
========
The project uses Maven to build things, and takes the form of a multi module maven project.

Development was done using Eclipse, and guidelines found here: http://www.workreloaded.com/2011/09/android-build-automation/ were followed to get Eclipse, ADT and maven playing nicely together.
